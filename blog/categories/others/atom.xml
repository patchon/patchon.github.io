    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately (or actually since way back, I&rsquo;ve just started to notice it a bit more nowdays) I&rsquo;ve been getting this annoying error when downloading subtitles from <a href="http://opensubtitles.org">opensubtitles.org</a>, smplayer finds the subtitle and starts to download it, but fails at random points during the download and throws the error &ldquo;failed to download subtitle&rdquo;. Today I set out to fix this annoying problem &ndash; however, it didn&rsquo;t take me long to find out that there actually was a bugreport on this, <b>and</b> that the bug also been fixed in later svn-revisions.
<del>I checked out the latest source (3614 as of writing) and built the packages for Ubuntu 10.04/11.04, feel free to grab them them <a href="http://blog.fridns.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/smplayer_0.6.9-SVN-r3614_amd64.deb">here</a> (10.04) and <a href="http://blog.fridns.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/smplayer_0.6.9-SVN-r3614_11.04_amd64.deb">here</a>(11.04).
Once downloaded, just install them with dpkg,

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a very annoying sound (a drumroll) at the login of Ubuntu 11.04 (I think it applies to earlier version to, although this method of disabling it does not, it should however work on Fedora 15). There is a gui (System/Administration/Login Screen) for making this happen, although it seems rather broken (read about it <a href=http://askubuntu.com/questions/24946/how-do-i-disable-the-drum-beat-sound-on-the-login-screen>here</a>). Nowadays dconf (gsettings is the api) is used as backend rather then gconf, although not all applications has adapted this, gdm has.
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-233"></a></p>

<!--more-->


<p>So what it boils down to is basically &ldquo;set the right gsettings for the gdm-user (since gdm is started by the user gdm)&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s how,</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>Become root in whatever way you want, <br></h1>

<p>su &ndash;</p>

<h1>Start a shell as the gdm-user,</h1>

<p>su &ndash; gdm -s /bin/bash</p>

<h1>Start a session-bus,</h1>

<p>eval $(dbus-launch &mdash;sh-syntax)</p>

<h1>Set the right settings through gsettings,</h1>

<p>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.sound event-sounds false</p>

<h1>Logout,</h1>

<p>exit
```
Thanks to Norman Smith that&rsquo;s mentioning the above solution in this <a href=https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=503360#c30>bugzilla</a>.</p>

    <updated>2011-06-21T23:17:36+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.fridns.se/blog/2011/06/21/ubuntu-classic-flash-fullscreen</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re using the &ldquo;Ubuntu Classic (No effects)&rdquo;-mode in the latest Ubuntu (11.04 as of writing) there is an annoying problem with playing fullscreen flash &ndash; <strong>it doesn&rsquo;t work.</strong> The picture will either freeze or get black, sound is still playing though, but there is <b>no way</b> you will get any fullscreen.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It took me a couple of hours to find it, but the solution, once you know it, is quite simple &ndash; just enable &ldquo;legacy fullscreen&rdquo; in compiz.</p>

<p>Simply install the "compizconfig-settings-manager"
<code>bash
sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
</code></p>

<p>Launch it, either by a terminal (/usr/bin/ccsm) or by,
System <strong>=&gt;</strong> Preferences <strong>=&gt;</strong> &ldquo;CompizConfig Settings Manager&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once in the application,
Click on Utility <strong>=&gt;</strong> Workarounds <strong>=&gt;</strong> Check the &ldquo;Legacy Fullscreen Support&rdquo; option.</p>

<p>Close &ldquo;CompizConfig Settings Manager&rdquo;,
<b>=></b> log out,
<b>=></b> log back in,
and you <strong>should</strong> be able to watch flash in fullscreen.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote,</strong><br>
Depending on which backend you use (normally gconf) the settings are stored as follows,
``` bash</p>

<h1>gconf,</h1>

<p>$HOME/.gconf/apps/compizconfig-1/profiles/Default/plugins/workarounds/screen0/options/%gconf.xml</p>

<h1>ini,</h1>

<p>$HOME/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig/Default.ini</blockquote>
```
<b>Update, 20110624</b><br>
After playing with flash some more I find that this solution is not fully working. In fact the solution suggested above is incorrect (I have no idea why I thought it worked the first time &ndash; the problem seems to be random and flash just happened to worked when I activated &ldquo;Legace fullscreen support&rdquo;),  because when using &ldquo;Ubuntu Classic (no effects) you&rsquo;re not using compiz at all (which makes sense when you think about it) which in turns would make the compiz-options useless (read, since compiz is not used, the settings aren&rsquo;t either). <b>At least</b> that&rsquo;s how I think it is, if anyone have any better explanation, please share it in the comments below.</p>

<p>After hours of fiddling with this I finally gave up, I thought I would give Ubunbu Classic a shot (using compiz that is) and flash actually now worked as expected (I tried with/without the &ldquo;Legacy fullscreen support&rdquo;, but I didn&rsquo;t noticed any differences so I decided to just leave the option on). The reason in the first place why I didn&rsquo;t want compiz and all the effects is because I think it clutters up my desktop, but with compizconfig-settings-manager you&rsquo;re able to disable most of them, so for now compiz is enabled &ndash; only so I can watch flash in fullscreen on various sites.</p>

<p><b>Worth mentioning,</b><br></p>

<ul>
<li>When using Ubuntu Classic (No effects) I could get fullscreen to work <b>if</b> the browserwindow was not maximized. The video would then go fullscreen in the background (that is, behind the browserwindow) and as soon as I moved the mouse from the browserwindow to the fullscreen I would get a working fullscreen. However this is not a working solution for me.<br></li>
<li>For some reason, now when I&rsquo;m playing with compizconfig-settings-manager the settings seem to be stored in <br></li>
</ul>


<p>$HOME/.gconf/apps/compiz-1/plugins/workarounds/screen0/options/%gconf.xml<br>
instead of as I earlier thought <br>
$HOME/.gconf/apps/compizconfig-1/profiles/Default/plugins/workarounds/screen0/options/%gconf.xml<br>
Not really surewhats going on here though.</p>

<p><b>Finally,</b><br>
If you could get the sites below show flash in fullscreen with<br>
&ndash; Ubuntu 11.04 in Classic Mode (No Effects),<br>
&ndash; Google Chrome, <br>
&ndash; Native 64 Flash plugin (square) <br>
&ndash; on an ION2-based platform, <br>
please tell me how you did it. <br></p>

<p><b>Update, 20110625</b><br>
Disabling &ldquo;Legacy fullscreen support&rdquo; since it seems to break xbmc&rsquo;s &ldquo;quick fullscreen switching&rdquo; (<b>alt+backslash</b>).

    <link href="http://blog.fridns.se/blog/2011/06/19/spotify-linux-now-with-pulseaudio-support/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-19T19:32:36+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.fridns.se/blog/2011/06/19/spotify-linux-now-with-pulseaudio-support</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re a Linux user and a paying customer to the great <a href="http://www.spotify.com/se/">Spotify-service</a> you nowdays have a native <a href="http://www.spotify.com/se/download/previews/">functional client</a>,</p>

<ul>
<li>With PulseAudio Support</li>
<li>With incicator-sound integration</li>
<li>All the other regular functions you would excpect out of a client.</li>
</ul>


<p>Although this client works pretty much out of the box, there are some things that you may have to do by hand.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><b>1)</b> Since Spotify has been linked to to <b>/usr/lib/libpulse.so.0</b> you must make sure that this file is in place, otherwise Spotify will use ALSA and you wont get a functional volume-control.
<code>bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libpulse.so.0 /usr/lib/libpulse.so
</code></p>

<p><b>2)</b> To get the album-art in the indicator-sound-applet you must make sure that you have <b>$HOME/.cache/indicators/sound/</b> in place, otherwise the applet wont be able to create a tmp-folder for its album-art. I&rsquo;ve filed a bug on this matter, you can read about it <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/indicator-sound/+bug/799383">here</a>. Basically the creation of the folder is done without making sure the folders parents are in place (eg. mkdir /tmp/foo/bar instead of mkdir -p /tmp/foo/bar, the first method is fine if you <b><em>can be sure</em></b> that /tmp/foo will be there, the -p flag will create /tmp/foo first if missing).</p>

<p><code>
mkdir $HOME/.cache/indicators/sound/album-art-cache
</code>
Spotify ftw.</p>

    <id>http://blog.fridns.se/blog/2011/04/22/drop_caches-as-nonroot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I got a request from a developer at our company regarding drop_caches. You can read about what it is and why it could be useful <a href="http://linux-mm.org/Drop_Caches">here</a>, but to make it short, this person wanted to do some benchmarking and needed the page/inode/dentry cache to be freed. Since this is needed to be done by root, this caused a problem (developer is not root, our infrastructure setup doesn&rsquo;t allow our developers to be root atm). Although I came up with a pretty neet sudo rule that does the job,
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-142"></a>
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>/sbin/sysctl -w vm.drop_caches<span class="o">=[</span>1-3<span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>
Just put the above command in <b>/etc/sudoers</b> for affected users and they should be able to free page/inode/dentry cache as they wish.</p>

<p>Keep it simple.</p>
